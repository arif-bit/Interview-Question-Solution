Given a list of strings book, page an index (0-indexed) into the book, and page_size, return the list of words on that page.

If the page is out of index, return an empty list.

Example 1
Input

book = ["concrete", "genuine", "plaster", "compact", "operation", "truth", "west"]
page = 1
page_size = 3
Output

["compact", "operation", "truth"]

Solution:

This question tests your knowledge of the slice operation. page * page_size is the actual index of the first word of the answer. 
You then slice forward to collect another page_size words.


class Solution:
    def solve(self, book, page, page_size):
        return book[page * page_size : page * page_size + page_size]
