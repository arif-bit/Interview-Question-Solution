Given a list of positive integers nums, return the number of integers that have odd number of digits.

Example 1
Input

nums = [1, 800, 2, 10, 3]
Output

4

Solution:

I make a string of the element check the length is odd or even using length mod by 2 not equal to 0.
If the length was not even i added it to list.Finally return the length of it.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        # Write your code here
        return len([i for i in nums if len(str(i))%2!=0])
