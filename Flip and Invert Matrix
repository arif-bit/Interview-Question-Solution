You are given a two-dimensional integer matrix matrix containing 1s and 0s. For each row in matrix, reverse the row. Then, flip each value in the matrix such that any 1 becomes 0 and any 0 becomes 1.

Constraints

n, m â‰¤ 250 where n and m are the number of rows and columns in matrix
Example 1
Input

matrix = [
    [1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1],
    [0, 0, 0]
]
Output

[
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1]
]


Solution:

class Solution:
    def solve(self, matrix):
        return [[1^i for i in row[::-1]] for row in matrix]
