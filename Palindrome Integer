Given a non-negative integer num, return whether it is a palindrome.

Bonus: Can you solve it without using strings?


Solution:
Now let us consider an algorithm for the Problem Statement: Find if a number is a Palindrome or not.

Copy the input number in another variable so that we can compare them later.
Next, we reverse the given number. To reverse the number follow these steps:
    Isolate the last digit of a number. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of a division
    Append rem to reverse. result= (result * 10) + rem.
    Remove last digit from number. num = num // 10.
    Iterate this process. while (num> 0)
Now we compare the reversed number with the original number.
If the numbers are the same, then the number is a palindrome ,else it is not

Now that we have the algorithm let us convert it into code by following the similar logic.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, num):
        # Write your code here
        s=num
        result=0
        while(num>0):
            rem=num%10
            result=result*10+rem
            num=num//10
        
        if result==s:
            return True
        return False
