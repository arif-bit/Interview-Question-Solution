Given three numbers, a, b, and c, return their product, but if any two numbers are the same, they do not count.

Example 1
Input

a = 2
b = 3
c = 4
Output

24


Solution:

Count the number occurances of each value, if the occurance is equal to 1 multiply with that number

from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def solve(self, a, b, c):
        l=Counter([a,b,c])
        ans=1
        for i in l:
            if l[i]==1:
                ans*=i
        return ans
