Given two sorted lists of integers, merge them into one large sorted list.

For example, given these two lists:

lst0 = [5, 10, 15]
lst1 = [3, 8, 9]

Return [3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 15].

Solution:

I just use a for loop add to append second list element with first list element
After that sorted the full list.
Code

This submission will be posted.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, lst0, lst1):
        # Write your code here

        for i in lst1:
            lst0.append(i)
        return sorted(lst0)
