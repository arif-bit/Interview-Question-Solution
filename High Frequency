Given a list of integers nums, find the most frequently occurring element and return the number of occurrences of that element.

Constraints

    0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums

Example 1
Input

nums = [1, 4, 1, 7, 1, 7, 1, 1]


Solution:

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        s = {}
        for i in nums:
            if i in s:
                s[i] += 1
            else:
                s[i] = 1
        return max(s.values()) if len(nums)> 0 else 0
