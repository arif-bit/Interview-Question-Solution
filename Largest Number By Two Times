Given a list of integers, return whether the largest number is bigger than the second-largest number by more than two times.

For example, given the list [3, 9, 6], you should return false, since 9 is not bigger than 12 (2 times 6).

Given the list [6, 3, 15], you should return true, since 15 is bigger than 12 (2 times 6).


Solution:


I first make a list after that sort it ascending order.
Store the maximum number to a variable.
Again find the second largest number.
Now apply the condition
Large Number greater than Second Largest Number multiply it with two if it is true return True
otherwise everything is false.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        # Write your code here
        List = nums
        
        SList = sorted(List)
        LNumber = max(List)
        SLNumber = SList[-2]
        if LNumber > SLNumber * 2:
            return True
        else:
            return False
