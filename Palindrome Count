You are given a string s representing alphabet characters and an integer k. Return the number of palindromes you can construct of length k using only letters in s. Letters can be used more than once.

Example 1
Input

s = "ab"
k = 4
Output

4


Solution:

We have to create a palindrome. a palindrome is a mirror from the center. So, If we fix the first half, the second half is automatically fixed.

Image We have K = 4. we have _ _ _ _ . So, We need to only fill the first half (first 2 places). The second half is automatically fixed based on first.

Now, If we have 5 unique chars to choose from. We have 5 possibilities for each filling position.
So, formula become easy and we (have unique_char)^(number of filling position).

if K is odd, we have one more position to fill then even.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, k):
        N = len(set(s))

        return N ** (k // 2 + k % 2)
