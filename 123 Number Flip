You are given an integer n consisting of digits 1, 2, and 3 and you can flip one digit to a 3. Return the maximum number you can make.
Example 1

Input

n = 123

Output

323

Solution:


First i make that number to a string.
Run a loop and check that number is it 3 .
if all number is 3 return that number if not change that number and merge it again return.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        value=list(str(n))
        for i in range(len(value)):
            if value[i]!='3':
                value[i]='3'
                return int(''.join(value))
        return n
