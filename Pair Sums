Given a list of positive integers nums, return the number of valid pairs of indices (i, j), with i < j, such that A[i] + A[j] is an odd number.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input

nums = [3, 2, 4]
Output

2

Solution:

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        odds = sum(v & 1 for v in nums)
        return odds*(len(nums)-odds)
