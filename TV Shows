Given a list of strings shows, a list of integers durations, and an integer k, 
where shows[i] and durations[i] represent the name and duration watched by the ith person, 
return the total duration watched of the k most watched shows.

Example 1
Input

shows = ["Top Gun", "Aviator", "Top Gun", "Roma", "Logan"]
durations = [5, 3, 5, 13, 4]
k = 2
Output

23

Solution:

It's like taking the k largest numbers out of an array, but first you need to combine the numbers belonging to the same title. We can do so using a dictionary.

from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def solve(self, shows, durations, k):
        d=defaultdict(int)
        for i,j in zip(shows,durations):
            d[i]+=j
        return sum(sorted(d.values())[-k::])
