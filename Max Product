Given a list of integers, find the largest product of two distinct elements.

Example 1
Input

nums = [5, 1, 7]
Output

35

Solution:

The final answer must be either the product of the two largest or two smallest (ie. potentially negative) values. 
The most convenient way to get these extremal values is just to sort the array, 
although we could also make a linear pass to get them in O(n) time.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        # Write your code here
        nums.sort()
        return max(nums[0]*nums[1],nums[-1]*nums[-2])
