The Connell sequence is a sequence made by:

Taking the first odd integer: 1
Taking the next two even integers 2, 4
Taking the next three odd integers 5, 7, 9
Taking the next four even integers 10, 12, 14, 16
And so on.
Given an integer n, return the nth (0-indexed) term of this sequence.

Constraints
