Given an integer n, return its base 3 representation as a string.

Example 1
Input

n = 5
Output

"12"

Solution:

If the number is negative, then multiply it by -1,
but remember that the sign is "-". Proceed as usual, taking the modulo and dividing. 
At the end, tack the sign onto the beginnning.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        res = ''
        sign = ''
        if n < 0:
            sign = '-'
            n *= -1
        while n > 0:
            res = str(n % 3) + res
            n //= 3
        return sign + res
