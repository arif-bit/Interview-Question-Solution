Given a lowercase alphabet string s, return whether it's possible to pick some subsequence of characters in s such that:

The difference of any two successive indexes of the characters is equal
The characters form the string "binarysearch"
Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 1,000 where n is the length of s.
Example 1
Input

s = "bziznzazrzyzszezazrzczh"
Output

True

Solution:

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        for d in range(1, n // 11 + 1):
            for i in range(n - 11 * d):
                if all(s[i + j * d] == c for j, c in enumerate("binarysearch")):
                    return True
        return False
