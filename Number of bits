Given an integer n greater than or equal to 0, return the number of 1 bits in n.
Example 1

Input

n = 0

Output

0

Example 2

Input

n = 1

Output

1


Solution:



First i convert it to a binary number
After that make a list of binary number.
Now make a new List.
If binary number equal to 1 add it to new list.Finally return the length of it.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        # Write your code here
        BinaryRep = bin(n)
        list = [i for i in BinaryRep]
        NList = []
        for i in list:
            if i == '1':
                NList.append(i)
        return len(NList)
