You are given a list of integers nums, representing a decimal number and nums[i] is between [0, 9].

For example, [1, 3, 9] represents the number 139.

Return the same list in the same representation except modified so that 1 is added to the number.

Constraints

    n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums.

Example 1

Input

nums = [1, 9, 1]

Output

[1, 9, 2]



Solution:


First i made a string list of that number and joined them make again them int add 1 with it again converted it to string after that again make a integer list of that numbers.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        # Write your code here
        if nums!=[]:
            joinNums=''.join([str(i) for i in nums])
            add1=str(int(joinNums)+1)
            newList=[int(i) for i in add1 ]
            return newList
        else:
            return []
