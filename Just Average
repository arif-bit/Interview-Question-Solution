Given a list of integers nums and an integer k, return true if you can remove exactly one element from the list to make the average equal to exactly k.

Constraints

2 ≤ n ≤ 1,000 where n is length of nums
nums[i], k ≤ 1,000,000
Example 1
Input

nums = [1, 2, 3, 10]
k = 2
Output

True

Solution:

sum(nums) - k * (n-1) is the value of a number which, if removed, would produce an average of k. We then check if this number is in the list

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, k):
        n = len(nums)
        return sum(nums) - k * (n - 1) in nums
