Given a list of integers nums, find the most frequently occurring element and return the number of occurrences of that element.

For example, given the list [1, 4, 1, 7, 1, 7, 1, 1], return 5 since the the element 1 appears 5 times.
Example 1

Input

nums = [1, 4, 1, 7, 1, 7, 1, 1]

Output

5


Solution:


I have use an dict to count the frequency of a number.
Initially if the the has available number = 1.If i found again then 2.
Finally returned the maximum value.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        # Write your code here
        freq = {}
        for item in nums:
            if (item in freq):
                freq[item] += 1
            else:
                freq[item] = 1
    
    
        return max(freq.values())
