You are given a list of integers nums, representing the number of chess matches each person has won. Return a relative ranking (0-indexed) of each person. If two players have won the same amount, their ranking should be the same.

Example 1
Input

nums = [50, 30, 50, 90, 10]
Output

[1, 2, 1, 0, 3]


Solution:

First, find all the uniquely occurring values in nums, sorted in decreasing order. Then map each of these values to its ranking index.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        SRev=sorted(set(nums), reverse=True)
        index = {v:i for i,v in enumerate(SRev)}
        return [index[i] for i in nums]
