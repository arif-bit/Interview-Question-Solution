An arithmetic sequence is a list of integers where the difference between one integer and the next is the same.

Given a list of integers nums, return the number of contiguous arithmetic sequences of length â‰¥ 3.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 10,000 where n is length of nums.
Example 1
Input

nums = [5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13]
Output

4

Solution:

from itertools import groupby
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        diff = [nums[i] - nums[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(nums))]
        ans = 0
        for _, grp in groupby(diff):
            l = len(list(grp))
            if l > 1:
                ans += l * (l - 1) // 2
        return ans
