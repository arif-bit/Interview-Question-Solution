Given an integer n, return a list with each number from 1 to n, except if it's a multiple of 3 or has a 3, 6, or 9 in the number, it should be the string "clap".

Note: return the number as a string.
Example 1

Input

n = 16

Output

["1", "2", "clap", "4", "5", "clap", "7", "8", "clap", "10", "11", "clap", "clap", "14", "clap", "clap"]

Soltuion:

Make the list of those numbers.
Use '3' in i or '6' in i or '9' in i to check if 3, 6, 9 in the number.
Use i% 3 to check if the number can be divided by 3.

If the condition failed no change or 'clap' will be replaced.

    def solve(self, n):
        # Write your code here

        list=[]
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            list.append(str(i))
        return ['clap' if int(i)%3==0 or'3' in i or '6' in i or '9' in i else i for i in list]
