Given a list of integers prices representing prices of cars for sale, and a budget k, return the maximum number of cars you can buy.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of prices
Example 1
Input

prices = [90, 30, 20, 40, 90]
k = 95
Output

3

Solution:

Since we just want the most cars, its always better to buy a cheaper car first.

This means we can consider buying the cars greedily in order from cheapest to most expensive.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, prices, k):
        prices.sort()
        ans=0
        for i in prices:
            if k>=i:
                k-=i
                ans+=1
        return ans
