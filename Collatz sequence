Given a positve integer n, find the length of its Collatz sequence. Collatz sequence is generated sequentially where

n = n / 2 if n is even
n = 3 * n + 1 if n is odd
And the sequence ends if n = 1
Example 1
Input

n = 11
Output

15

Solution:

class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        lst = []
        lst.append(n)
        while n != 1:
            n = (n // 2) if n % 2 == 0 else (3 * n + 1)
            lst.append(n)
        
        return len(lst)
