You are given a string s where each character is "L" meaning you moved one unit left, "R" meaning you moved one unit right, or "?" meaning either "L" or "R".

Given you are at position 0, return the maximum possible distance you could be from 0 by replacing "?" with "L" or "R".

Example 1
Input

s = "LLRRR??"
Output

3



Solution:

We can take the steps in any order, so let's take all the "R" steps first, then all the "L" steps. Starting from x=0, we would then be at position x = s.count('R') - s.count('L'), which is abs(x) away from the origin.

Now our last s.count('?') steps will walk away from the origin, so the final answer is abs(x) + s.count('?').

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        return abs(s.count("R") - s.count("L")) + s.count("?")
