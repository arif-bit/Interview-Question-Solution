Given an N by N matrix of letters matrix, return whether there are exactly N different letters that appear in the matrix and each letter appears exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.

Example 1
Input

matrix = [
    ["a", "b", "c"],
    ["c", "a", "b"],
    ["b", "c", "a"]
]
Output

True

Soluiton:

First we check the Count for each row and then each column and if it doesn't match then False else True.

from collections import Counter


class Solution:
    def solve(self, matrix):
        count = Counter(matrix[0])

        for i in matrix:
            if count != Counter(i):
                return False

        for i in zip(*matrix):
            if count != Counter(i):
                return False

        return True
