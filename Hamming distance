Given two integers x, and y return the number of positions where their values differ in their binary representations as a 32-bit integer.

Example 1
Input

x = 9
y = 5
Output

2

Solution:

Exor operation exor's the given decimal numbers bitwise on their corresponding binary notation.

So, Exor of 5 and 9, 5^9=

0101

1001

––––

1100 =12 in decimal

Now convert the decimal to bin and count the no.of 1's in the corresponding binary string.



class Solution:
    def solve(self, x, y):
        return str(bin(x^y)).count('1')
