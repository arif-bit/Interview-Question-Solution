Given a lowercase alphabet string s, return a string with all the vowels of s in sorted order followed by all the consonants of s in sorted order.

Note: vowels are ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"] and consonants are all other characters.

Constraints

    Length of s â‰¤ 50000

Example 1

Input

s = "decalin"

Output

"aeicdln"

Solution:



First i sort the list after that get the vowels and constants
add them using join method

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        # Write your code here
        s = sorted(s)
        vowels=["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]
        vowel=[i for i in s if i in vowels]
        constants=[i for i in s if i not in vowels]
        addBoth=vowel+constants
        return ''.join(addBoth)
