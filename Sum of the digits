Given a positive integer num, return the sum of its digits.

Bonus: Can you do it without using strings?


Solution:


For last digit i have to get the remainder .After that i have to add it with result.
Again i have to divide the number by 10 .Find the remainder again of that number.That's it.

Thanks

class Solution:
    def solve(self, num):
        # Write your code here
        result=0
        while(num>=1):
             last=num%10
             result=result+last
             num=num//10
        return round(result)
