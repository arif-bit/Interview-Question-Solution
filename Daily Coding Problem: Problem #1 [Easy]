# This problem was recently asked by Google.
#
# Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
#
# For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
#
# Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?



list=[10, 15, 3, 7]
def check(lst,k):
    for i in range(0,len(lst)):
        for j in range(1,len(lst)):
            if lst[i]+lst[j]==k:
                return True
        return False
print(check(list,17))
