Given a list of integers nums, sort the array such that:

All even numbers are sorted in increasing order
All odd numbers are sorted in decreasing order
The relative positions of the even and odd numbers remain the same
Example 1
Input

nums = [8, 13, 11, 90, -5, 4]
Output

[4, 13, 11, 8, -5, 90]


Solution:

Collect the elements and sort them separately, then insert them back into the array in the desired order.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        odds, evens = [], []
        for x in nums:
            if x % 2:
                odds.append(x)
            else:
                evens.append(x)

        odds.sort()
        evens.sort(reverse=True)

        for i, x in enumerate(nums):
            if x % 2:
                nums[i] = odds.pop()
            else:
                nums[i] = evens.pop()

        return nums
