Given a string s and an integer n, split up s into n-sized pieces.

For example, given:

s = "abcdefg"
n = 3

Return ["abc", "def", "g"].

If there are extra characters left over, they should be in its own piece.

Solution:

I use a list and run a for loop 0 to n using slice make a string chunks every time.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, n):
        # Write your code here
        return [s[i:i+n] for i in range(0, len(s), n)]
