Given a list of integers nums, return whether you can rearrange the order of nums such that the difference between every consecutive two numbers is the same.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input

nums = [7, 1, 5, 3]
Output

True


Solution:

We can simply sort the array and check if the number of distinct differences between each pair of consecutive elements is equal to 11.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        nums.sort()
        diffs = set()
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            diffs.add(nums[i] - nums[i - 1])
        return len(diffs) == 1
