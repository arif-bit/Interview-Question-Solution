Given two strings s0 and s1, each representing a sentence, return the number of unique words that are shared between the two sentences.

Note: words are case-insensitive so "hello" and "Hello" are the same word.

Example 1
Input

s0 = "hello world hello oyster"
s1 = "world is your oyster"
Output

2


Solution:

First make those string lower and split it after that make set of both .
Intersection both set to find common words.
Finally return length of it.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s0, s1):
        # Write your code here
        first = set(s0.lower().split())
        second = set(s1.lower().split())
        return len(first.intersection(second))
