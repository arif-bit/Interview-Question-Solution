You are given a list of integers fighters and a two dimensional list bosses. The fighters list contains 1s and 0s with a 1 representing a fighter. Similarly, each bosses list contains 1s and 0s with a 1 representing a boss.

Given that fighters can beat a bosses row if it contains more fighters than bosses, return a new bosses matrix with defeated boss rows removed.

Example 1
Input

fighters = [0, 1, 1]
bosses = [
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1]
]
Output

[
    [0, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 1]
]

Solution:

class Solution:
    def solve(self, fighters, bosses):
        lst=[]
        total=sum(fighters)
        for i in bosses:
            if sum(i)>=total:
                lst.append(i)
        return lst
