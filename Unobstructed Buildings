Unobstructed Buildings
Easy

You are given a list of integers heights representing building heights. A building heights[i] can see the ocean if every building on its right has shorter height. Return the building indices where you can see the ocean, in ascending order.

Constraints

0 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of heights
Example 1
Input
heights = [1, 5, 5, 2, 3]
Output
[2, 4]
Explanation
We can see the ocean in building heights[2] and heights[4].





Solution:

ans=[]
highest=-1
for i in range(len(heights)-1,-1,-1):
    if heights[i]>highest:
        ans.append(i)
        highest=heights[i]
print(ans[::-1])
