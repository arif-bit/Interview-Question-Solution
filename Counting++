Given a list of integers nums, return the number of elements x there are such that x + 1 exists as well.

Example 1
Input

nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 7]
Output

3

Solution:

Create a set of the nums so that you only have to lookup x+1 in a small set rather than the whole list.
Then just iterate and check.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        k=set(nums)
        return sum([1 for i in nums if i+1 in k])
