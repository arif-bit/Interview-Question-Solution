Given a singly linked list, return its length. The linked list has fields next and val.

Example 1
Input

node = 350
Output

1

solution:

Let's walk through each node in the given list, adding 1 to the final answer every time we meet a node.

# class LLNode:
#     def __init__(self, val, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def solve(self, node):
        ans = 0
        while node:
            ans += 1
            node = node.next
        return ans
