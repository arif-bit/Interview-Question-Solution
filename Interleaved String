Given two strings s0 and s1, return the two strings interleaved, starting with s0. If there are leftover characters in a string they should be added to the end.

Example 1
Input

s0 = "abc"
s1 = "xyz"
Output

"axbycz"

Solution:

Space: O(n), Time: O(n)

    Create iterator of tuples of characters with zip_longest(). Extra character will be paired with empty string by setting fillvalue.
    Flatten the iterator with chain.from_iterable().
    Concatenate the flattened iterator into a single string with ''.join()


from itertools import zip_longest
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s0, s1):
        # Write your code here

        return ''.join([i+j for i,j in zip_longest(s0,s1,fillvalue='')])
