Given a string s, determine whether it has all unique characters.







solution:

I First take the string using set remove the duplicate words .
Now it becomes a set so i have make it a string again. I use join() function to make again a string.
now check the length between two string if they are same True that means no duplicates otherwise False.

Thanks

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        # Write your code here
        GString=s
        Rduplicate=set(GString)
        JRDuplicate=''.join(Rduplicate)
        if len(GString)==len(JRDuplicate):
            return True
        else:
            return False
