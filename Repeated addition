Given a positive integer n, sum all of its digits to get a new number. Repeat this operation until it's less than 10.
Example 1

Input

n = 8835

Output

6

Solution:


I have to get the remainder with recursion until its greater than 0 and add +1 with it.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        # Write your code here
        return (n-1)%9+1
