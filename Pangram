Given a string s, representing a sentence, return whether every letter (case-insensitive) of the alphabet is used at least once.
Example 1

Input

s = "A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

Output

True


Solution:

I use the ASCII lowercase value form a to z and also a set of it.
Again make a set of user string.
Now check it greater or equal because if set removes duplicate now 
if all the ASCII value have in user string it can be greater or equal 
 here can be value from A to Z.
Code



import string
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        # Write your code here
        return set(s.lower())>=set(string.ascii_lowercase)
