Given two strings s0 and s1, return whether you can obtain s1 by removing 1 letter from s0.

Example 1
Input

s0 = "hello"
s1 = "hello"
Output

False


Solution:

Idea: Iterate thru every Letter in S0. If this letter were removed, would this be the same as S1? Then.. return True.
If we iterated thru the whole string S0 and still didn`t encounter S1, then False.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s0, s1):
        for i in range(len(s0)):
            if s0[:i]+s0[i+1:]==s1:
                return True
        return False
