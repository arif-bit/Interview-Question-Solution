You are given integers n and k. Given that n represents the number of games you will play, return the number of ways in which you win k or less games consecutively. Mod the result by 10 ** 9 + 7.

Constraints

n ≤ 10,000
k ≤ 10
Example 1
Input

n = 3
k = 2
Output

7

Solution:

from functools import lru_cache
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n, k):
        @lru_cache(None)
        def back(curr, pre):

            if curr == n:
                return 1
            ans = 0
            if pre < k:
                ans += back(curr + 1, pre + 1)
            ans += back(curr + 1, 0)
            return ans

        return back(0, 0) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
