You are given an integer n representing the length of an n by n board. Remove all cells that are diagonal to one of the four corners (top left, top right, bottom right, and bottom left) and return the number of empty cells leftover.

For example, given n = 4

X O O X
O X X O
O X X O
X O O X
We see there's 8 empty "O" squares.

Example 1
Input

n = 4
Output

8


Solution:

All n * n squares start empty, and 2 * n are removed from diagonals. Then, if n is odd, one center square was counted as removed twice, so we add it back in.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        return n * n - 2 * n + (n & 1)
