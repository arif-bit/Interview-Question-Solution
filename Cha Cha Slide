Given two strings s0 and s1, determine if one is a rotation of the other.

Constraints

    Length of s0 is at most 5000.
    Length of s1 is at most 5000.

Example 1

Input

s0 = "Cattywampus"
s1 = "sCattywampu"

Output

True


Solution:
First i check for the length if lengths are not same then its can not be rotate.
After that i take a loop and rotate x by 1 check is it equal to Y.
If same then its rotation is possible otherwise not.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, X, Y):
        # Write your code here
        
        m = len(X)
    
        # if lengths are different, they can't be
        # derived from each other
        if m != len(Y):
            return False
    
        # Invariant : At i'th iteration of this loop,
        # X will be rotated by i units
        for i in range(m):
    
            # left rotate X by 1 unit
            X = X[1:] + X[0]
    
            # return true if X becomes equal to Y
            if X == Y:
                return True
    
        # return false if no rotation is matched
        return False
