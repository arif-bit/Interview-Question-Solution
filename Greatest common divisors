Given a list of positive integers nums, return the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers.

Example 1
Input

nums = [6, 12, 9]
Output

3

Solution:

If we need to find gcd of more than two numbers, gcd is equal to the product of the prime factors common to all the numbers provided as arguments. 
It can also be calculated by repeatedly taking the GCDs of pairs of numbers of arguments.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        def findgcd(x, y):
            while y:
                x, y = y, x % y
            return x
        if len(nums)>1:   
            num1 = nums[0]
            num2 = nums[1]
            gcd = findgcd(num1, num2)
            for i in range(2, len(nums)):
                gcd = findgcd(gcd, nums[i])
            return gcd
        else:
            return nums[0]
