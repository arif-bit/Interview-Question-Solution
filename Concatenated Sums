You are given a list of non-negative integers nums. Return the sum of every concatenation of every pair of numbers in nums. Note that pairs (i, j) and (j, i) are considered different.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input

nums = [10, 2]
Output

1344

Solution:

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        x = len(nums) + sum(10 ** len(str(x)) for x in nums)
        return sum(i * x for i in nums)
