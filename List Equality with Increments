You are given a list of integers nums, and want to make the values equal. Consider an operation where you pick an integer in the list and increment every other value .

Return the minimum number of operations required to make integer values equal.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input

nums = [1, 3, 4]
Output

5

Solution:


class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        mn = min(nums)
        return sum(x - mn for x in nums)
