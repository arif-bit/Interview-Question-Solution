You are given a list nums of length n + 1 picked from the range 1, 2, ..., n. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be a duplicate. Find and return it. There is guaranteed to be exactly one duplicate.

Bonus: Can you do this in linear time and constant space?

Constraints

    n â‰¤ 100,000

Example 1

Input

nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]

Output

1


Solution:




I use a set to ensure that if there is any duplicates number.
if has than return it
otherwise add it to set.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        # Write your code here
        seen = set()
        for num in nums:
            if num in seen:
                return num
            seen.add(num)
