Given a list of integers nums, return whether it represents a max heap. That is, for every i we have that:

nums[i] ≥ nums[2*i + 1] if 2*i + 1 is within bounds
nums[i] ≥ nums[2*i + 2] if 2*i + 2 is within bounds
Example 1
Input

nums = [4, 2, 3, 0, 1]
Output

True

Solution:

Since to satisfy the requirements of the max heap, to deal with the out of bounds, just use try and except method.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            try:
                if nums[i] < nums[2 * i + 1] or nums[i] < nums[2 * i + 2]:
                    return False
            except:
                continue
        return True
