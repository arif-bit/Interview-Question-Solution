You are given two strings s and t which both have length n. 
You can pick one character in s and another in t and swap them. 
Given you can make unlimited number of swaps, return whether it's possible to make the two strings equal.

Example 1
Input

s = "ab"
t = "ba"
Output

True



Solution:

count the frequency of each unique letter in the combination list of s and t

if all frequencies are even, the two strings can be made to be same.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, t):
        # Write your code here
        st=s+t
        return all([st.count(i)%2==0 for i  in set(st)])
