You are given an integer n representing n full beer bottles. Given that you can exchange 3 empty beer bottles for 1 full beer bottle, return the number of beer bottles you can drink.

Example 1
Input

n = 9
Output

13

Solution:

While there are full bottles we drink them all.
Then we put them to our empty bottles.
Finally we can exchange each triplet of empty bottles for a tasty new full bottle.
And the drinking goes on...
Cheers!

class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        # Write your code here
        empty=0
        drunk=0
        while n:
            drunk+=n
            empty+=n
            n=empty//3
        
            empty=empty%3
        return drunk
