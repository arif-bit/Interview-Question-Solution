Given a string s and an integer n, rearrange s into n rows so that s can be read vertically (top-down, left to right).

For example, given s = "abcdefghi" and n = 5, return:

["af",
 "bg",
 "ch",
 "di",
 "e"]
Constraints

Length of s ≤ 10000
n ≤ 1000
Example 1
Input

s = "abcdefghi"
n = 5
Output

["af", "bg", "ch", "di", "e"]



Solution:

s[i::n] is a slice of `s` that means every `n` characters of s[i:], starting with the first.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, n):
        return [s[i::n] for i in range(n)]
