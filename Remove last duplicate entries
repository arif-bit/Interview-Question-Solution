Given a list of integers nums, find all duplicate numbers and delete their last occurrences.

For example, given [1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 5] return [1, 3, 4, 5].

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input

nums = [1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 5]
Output

[1, 3, 4, 5]

Solution:

Here we make a set for the last occurrences and a Counter. If Counter is more than 1 then we pop the value from nums and at last return it.

from collections import Counter


class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        count = Counter(nums)
        ls = set()

        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            if count[nums[i]] > 1 and nums[i] not in ls:
                ls.add(nums[i])
                nums.pop(i)
        return nums
