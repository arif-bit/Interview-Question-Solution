You are given integers n, a and b. You are standing in a line of n people. You don't know which position you're in, but you know there are at least a people in front of you and at most b people behind you.

Return the number of possible positions you could be in.

Example 1
Input

n = 10
a = 3
b = 4
Output

5


Solution:

If there are at most b people behind you, your position can vary between 0 and 
b+1 (+1 because you are at the position after the bth person). 
If at least a people are in front of you, your position varies between 0 and n-a.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, n, a, b):
        return min(n-a,b+1)
