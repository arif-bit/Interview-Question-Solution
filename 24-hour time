Given a string s, representing a 12-hour clock time with am/pm, return its 24-hour equivalent.

Example 1
Input

s = "05:30pm"
Output

"17:30"
Example 2
Input

s = "03:00am"
Output

"03:00"
Example 3
Input

s = "12:00pm"
Output

"12:00"




Solution:


First i get the remainder of hours and add 12 with it if it is pm.
Make no change about minutes.

Add additional one zero before hours and minutes for padding with left alignment.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        # Write your code here
        hour = int(s[:2]) % 12
        minutes = int(s[3:5])
    
        if 'pm' in s:
            hour += 12
    
        return "{:02}:{:02}".format(hour, minutes)
