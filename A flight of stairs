There's a staircase with n steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time.

Given an integer n, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters, so each different order of steps counts as a way.

Mod the result by 10 ** 9 + 7

Example 1
Input

n = 4
Output

5



Solution:

class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        n0 = 0
        n1 = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            n0, n1 = n1, n0 + n1
        return (n0 + n1) % ((10 ** 9) + 7)
