Given an integer n greater than or equal to 0, return whether it is a power of two.
Example 1

Input

n = 0

Output

False


Solution:


I have use python build in math log() function. That's works for me.

import math
class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        # Write your code here
        if n==0:
            return False
        return math.log(n,2).is_integer()
