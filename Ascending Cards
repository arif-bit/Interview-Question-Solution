You are given a list of integers cards, and are looking to order the cards in a way so that they are revealed in ascending order.

The cards are revealed in this manner: the top card is removed and revealed and then next card is moved to the back. This is repeated until there's no more cards.

Return an ordering of the cards such that they are revealed in ascending order.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of cards
Example 1
Input

cards = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output

[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]

Solution:

import collections
class Solution:
    def solve(self, cards):
        dq = collections.deque()
        for c in sorted(cards, key=lambda x: -x):
            s=dq.rotate()
            dq.appendleft(c)

        return list(dq)
