Given a positive integer n representing the amount of cents you have, return the formatted currency amount. For example, given n = 123456, return "1,234.56".

Example 1
Input

n = 132
Output

"1.32"

Solution:

We can use Python's built in standard format specifiers, which conveniently have an option for grouping currencies.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        return "{:,.2f}".format(n / 100)
