Given an integer n, return a list of integers from 1 to n as strings except for multiples of 3 use “Fizz” 
instead of the integer and for the multiples of 5 use “Buzz”. For integers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 use “FizzBuzz”.
Example 1

Input

n = 15

Output

["1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz", "Fizz", "7", "8", "Fizz", "Buzz", "11", "Fizz", "13", "14", "FizzBuzz"]


I use a for loop to generate number from 1 to n+1
use 3 condition with continue because this will ignore those numbers and added that value that place.
using string make all the integer value to string.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        # Write your code here
        list = []
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            if i%3==0 and i%5==0:
                list.append('FizzBuzz')
                continue
            elif i%5==0:
                list.append('Buzz')
                continue
            elif i%3==0:
                list.append('Fizz')
                continue
        
            list.append(str(i))
        return list
