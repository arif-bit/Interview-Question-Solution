Given two lists of integers nums, and target, consider an operation where you take some sublist in nums and reverse it. Return whether it's possible to turn nums into target, given you can make any number of operations.

Example 1
Input

nums = [1, 2, 3, 8, 9]
target = [3, 2, 1, 9, 8]
Output

True

Solution:

from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, target):
        return Counter(nums)==Counter(target)
