Given positive integers start and end (start < end), return the minimum number of operations needed to convert start to end using these operations:

Increment by 1
Multiply by 2
Constraints

start < end < 2 ** 31
Example 1
Input

start = 2
end = 9
Output

3


Solution:

Starting from end dividing by 2 if even and decrementing by 1 if it is odd and returning the count.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, start, end):
        ct = 0
        while end / 2 >= start:
            if end % 2 == 1:
                end -= 1
                end = end / 2
                ct += 2
            else:
                end = end / 2
                ct += 1
        ct += end - start
        return ct
