The factorial of a number n is defined as n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 1.

Given a positive integer a, return n such that n! = a. If there is no integer n that is a factorial, then return -1.

Constraints

n < 2 ** 31
Example 1
Input

a = 6
Output

3

Solution:

We start multiplying cur = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... When we get to `cur >= target`, we stop. If `cur == target` then we were successful and output the answer.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, target):
        cur = n = 1
        while cur < target:
            n += 1
            cur *= n
        return n if cur == target else -1
