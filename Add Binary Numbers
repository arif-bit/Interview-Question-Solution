Given two strings a and b that represent binary numbers, add them and return their sum, also as a string.

The input strings are guaranteed to be non-empty and contain only 1s and 0s.
Example 1

Input

a = "1"
b = "1"

Output

"10"


Solution:
Use int() and bin() to add two binary numbers in Python

Convert each of the binary operands into integers using int(number, 2). Add the integers together and use bin(sum) to convert the integer sum back to a binary string.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, a, b):
        # Write your code here
        return bin(int(a,2) + int(b,2))[2:]
