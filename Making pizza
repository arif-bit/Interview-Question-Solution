Given a lowercase alphabet string s, return how many "pizza" strings you can create using the characters in s. You can use the characters in s in any order, but you can only use each character once.

Example 1
Input

s = "pihzzatpizza"
Output

2


Solution:

count the number of "p", "i", "z", "a" and divide number of "z" by 2 since 
there are two "z" in the word "pizza" and return the minimum value of all these counts.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        # Write your code here
        p=s.count('p')
        i=s.count('i')
        z=s.count('z')
        a=s.count('a')
        return min(p,i,z//2,a)
