Given a list of integers nums, return the number of times that the list changes from positive-to-negative or negative-to-positive slope.

Example 1
Input

nums = [1, 3, 9, 7, 5, 10, 12]
Output

2


Solution:

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        return sum((a > b < c) or (a < b > c) for a, b, c in zip(nums, nums[1:], nums[2:]))
