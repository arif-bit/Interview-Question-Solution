You are given a string dictionary, representing a partial lexicographic ordering of ancient astronauts' dictionary. Given a string s, return whether it's a lexicographically sorted string according to this ancient astronaut dictionary.

Example 1
Input

dictionary = "acb"
s = "aaaa h ccc i bbb"
Output

True


Solution:

It would look like this [0,0,0,1,1,1,2 ...]

If its not ordered we would have [0,0,1,1,3,0 ...] 0 is out or order.

1 - Create index array from s

2- Check the ordering. Return False on failure


class Solution:
    def solve(self, dictionary, s):
        dict=[dictionary.index(i) for i in s if i in dictionary]
        i=0
        while i<len(dict)-1:
            if dict[i+1]<dict[i]:
                return False
            i+=1
        return True
