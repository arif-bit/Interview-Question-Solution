Given a sorted unique integer list of size n in increasing order, find the first positive integer between [1, n+1] not in the array.

Example 1
Input

arr = [2, 3, 4]
Output

1


Solution:

class Solution:
    def solve(self, arr):
        ct = 1
        for i in arr:
            if i == ct:
                ct += 1
            else:
                pass
        return ct
