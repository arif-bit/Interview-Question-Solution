Given a list of integers nums, return the length of the shortest sublist in nums which if sorted would make nums sorted in ascending order.

Example 1
Input

nums = [0, 1, 4, 3, 8, 9]
Output

2

Solution:
Sort nums and save in lst
Find the first index where nums and lst differ
Find the last index where nums and lst differ
return "last index - first index + 1", i.e., the length of range that has difference between two lists.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        lst = sorted(nums)
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != lst[i]:
                break
        for j in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            if nums[j] != lst[j]:
                break
        return j - i + 1 if j > i else 0
