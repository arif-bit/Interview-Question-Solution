You are given a string s and an integer k. Each character in the string is either '.' or 'x', where '.' represents an empty space and 'x' represents a person.

Return whether it's possible to choose a position to stand on such that the distance between you and the closest person to you is at least k. (The distance between each neighbouring indices is 1).

Example 1
Input

s = "x.."
k = 2
Output

True


Solution:

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, k):
        inner = "." * (2 * k - 1)
        outer = "." * k
        return inner in s or s.startswith(outer) or s.endswith(outer)
