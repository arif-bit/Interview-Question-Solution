Given a string password, return whether these conditions are met:

At least 8 characters and at most 20 characters.
Contains at least one digit
Contains at least one lower alphabetical character and one upper alphabetical character
Contains at least one character within a set of special characters: !"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~
Does not contain any other character such as tabs or new lines.
Example 1
Input

password = "aA0@1234"
Output

True


Solution:

Simply check all the given conditions and return False if any of the conditions not met.

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)


n = len(password)

        special = "!\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~"

        if not 8 <= n <= 20:
            return False

        if not any(c.isdigit() for c in password):
            return False

        if not any(c.islower() for c in password):
            return False

        if not any(c.isupper() for c in password):
            return False

        if not any(c in special for c in password):
            return False

        if any(not c.isalnum() and c not in special for c in password):
            return False

        return True
