You are given a two-dimensional list of strings contacts. Each element contacts[i] represents the list of emails for contact i. Contact i is considered a duplicate if there's a j < i such that contact j shares a common email with i. Return the number of unique people in contacts.

Constraints

    0 ≤ n ≤ 100,000 where n is the total number of strings in contacts

Example 1
Input

contacts = [
    ["elon@tesla.com", "elon@paypal.com"],
    ["elon@tesla.com", "elon@spacex.com"],
    ["tim@apple.com"]
]

Output

2

Solution:

class Solution:
    def solve(self, contacts):
        seen = set()
        ret = 0
        for contact_list in contacts:
            ret += all([contact not in seen for contact in          contact_list])
            seen |= set(contact_list)
        return ret
