Given two strings a, and b, both representing an integer, add them and return it in the same string representation.

Bonus: can you implement the addition directly, instead of using eval or built-in big integers?

Constraints`

n ≤ 200 where n is the length of a
m ≤ 200 where m is the length of b
Example 1
Input

a = "12"
b = "23"
Output

"35"

Solution:

First get the equivalent int of it and sum of those.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, a, b):
        # Write your code here

        newa=0
        for i in  a:
            newa*=10
            for d in '0123456789':
                newa+=i>d
        
        newb=0
        for i in  b:
            newb*=10
            for d in '0123456789':
                newb+=i>d
        total=newa+newb
        return f'{total}'
