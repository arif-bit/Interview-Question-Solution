A Roomba robot is currently sitting in a cartesian plane at (0, 0). You are given a list of its moves that it will make, containing NORTH, SOUTH, WEST, and EAST.

Return whether after its moves it will end up in the coordinate (x, y).

Example 1
Input

moves = ["NORTH", "EAST"]
x = 1
y = 1
Output

True


Solution:

class Solution:
    def solve(self, moves, x, y):
        return (
            moves.count("EAST") - moves.count("WEST") == x
            and moves.count("NORTH") - moves.count("SOUTH") == y
        )
