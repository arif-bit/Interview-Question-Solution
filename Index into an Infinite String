You are given a string s and two integers i and j where i < j. Let's say p is an infinite string of s repeating forever. Return the substring of p from indexes [i, j).

Example 1
Input

s = "tiger"
i = 6
j = 8
Output

"ig"

Solution:

s[k % len(s)] tells us the `k`-th position in s if the string is repeated forever.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s, i, j):
        return "".join(s[k % len(s)] for k in range(i, j))
