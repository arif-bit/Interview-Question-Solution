Given a string s representing characters typed into an editor, with "<-" representing a backspace, return the current state of the editor.

Example 1
Input

s = "abc<-z"
Output

"abz"
Explanation

The "c" got deleted by the backspace.

Solution:

Here I replaced all "<-" with " " so that 
it becomes easy for us to understand and manipulate the string. 
Now simply appending and popping values and returning the string made from list.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        news = s.replace('<-', ' ')
        lst = []
        for i in news:
            if i != ' ':
                lst.append(i)
            else:
                if len(lst) != 0:
                    lst.pop()
        return ''.join(lst)
