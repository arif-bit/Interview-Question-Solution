Given a list of integers nums, return whether all numbers appear an even number of times.

This should be done in \mathcal{O}(1)O(1) space.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input

nums = [2, 4, 4, 2, 3, 3]
Output

True
Explanation

Every number occurs twice.


Solution:

First sort the list check the is even or not and also check each pair is equal or not.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        # Write your code here
        nums.sort()
        return (
            len(nums)%2==0 and all([nums[i]==nums[i+1] for i in range(0,len(nums),2)])
        )
