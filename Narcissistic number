Given an integer n, return whether it is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

Example 1
Input

n = 153
Output

True


Solution:

Just do what the problem says.
We use a list comprehension to write each digit into an array. 
This makes it easy to calculate the required sum of powers.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        return n == sum([ int(i)**(len(str(n))) for i in str(n)])
