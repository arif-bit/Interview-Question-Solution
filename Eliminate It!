Given a string s, remove all “y” and “xz” in the string in one iteration.

Example 1
Input

s = "xyxyxz"
Output

"xx"

Solution:

In a regular expression, you can say you'd like to match one thing OR another by using '|'

Here, we match y OR xz by writing (y|xz)

We tell the engine to replace what it found with the empty string.

import re
class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        return re.sub(r'y|xz','',s)
