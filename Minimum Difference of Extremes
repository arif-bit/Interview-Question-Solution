Given a list of integers nums, consider an operation where you update an element to any value. Given that you can perform at most 3 of these operations, return the resulting minimum difference between the max and the min value in nums.

Constraints

n ≤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output

2


Solution:

    Sort the array and take the min of the 4 pairs

Complexity

    Time: O(nlog⁡n)\mathcal{O}(n\log{n})O(nlogn)
    Space: O(1)\mathcal{O}(1)O(1)

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        # Write your code here
        if len(nums) <= 4:
            return 0
        nums.sort()
        return min([nums[-4 + i] - nums[i] for i in range(4)])
