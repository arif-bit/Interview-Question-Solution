Given an n by n integer matrix, return the sum of all elements that form a Z in the matrix. For example, given:

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
The Z that's formed is [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9] and its sum is 35.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 1000
Example 1
Input

matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
Output

35

Solution:

In case the length of the matrix is 0, return 0.
In case the length of the matrix is 1, return the only element present in the matrix.
Else,
Take an array a and append all the elements of the diagonal such that the elements of the first row and the last row are not included.
The, append the sum of the elements of the first and the last row to the array, a.
Finally, return the sum of the elements of the array, a.
