Given an integer n, return the maximum number you can make by inserting 5 anywhere in the number.

Example 1
Input

n = 923

Output

9523


Solution:
Just try all possible insertions, note that you can't start at index 0
if its negative because it will put a digit in front of the negative sign that why i use n<0

class Solution:
    def solve(self, n):
        # Write your code here
        strn=str(n)
        list=[]
        for i in range(n<0, len(strn) + 1):
            l=int(strn[:i]+'5'+strn[i:])
            list.append(l)
        return max(list)
