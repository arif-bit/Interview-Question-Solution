Given a string s consisting only of 1s and 0s, you can delete any two adjacent letters if they are different.

Return the length of the smallest string that you can make if you're able to perform this operation as many times as you want.

Example 1
Input

s = "11000"
Output

1


Solution:

If a zero and a one exist in s, it is always possible to find two of them that are side by side and delete them.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        return abs(s.count("0") - s.count("1"))
