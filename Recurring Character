Given a string, return the index of the first recurring character in it. If there are no recurring characters, return -1.

Example 1
Input

s = "abcda"
Output

4

Solution:
I used a dictionary to track which characters I have seen before.
As I iterate through the string,
I check if I've seen the character before (i.e. if the character exists in the dictionary). 
If so, return the index.

`enumerate` is a nice built-in function that returns me the index and character at the same time!

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        # Write your code here
        dict={}
        for i,j in enumerate(s):
            if j in dict:
                return i
            dict[j]=1
        return -1
