Given a string s, consisting of "X" and "Y", delete the minimum number of characters such that there's no consecutive "X" and no consecutive "Y".

Example 1
Input

s = "YYYXYXX"
Output

"YXYX"


Solution:

We replace any YYs with Y instead

And keep iterating through the string till all of those duplicates are gone!

class Solution:
    def solve(self, s):
        while "YY" in s or "XX" in s:
            s = s.replace("YY", "Y")
            s = s.replace("XX", "X")
        return s
