Given a list of integers nums, a string op representing either "+", "-", "/", or "*", and an
integer val, perform the operation on every number in nums with val and return the result.

Note: "/" is integer division.
Example 1

Input

nums = [3, 1, 6]
op = "+"
val = 4

Output

[7, 5, 10]

Explanation

We add 4 to every number in nums and return it.


Solution:



I just use if else condition
if op match to '+' than the for loop to add the elements with it
if op match to '-' than the for loop to subtract the elements with it
The two condition left they are also same.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums, op, val):
        # Write your code here
        if op=='+':
            return [i+val for i in nums]
        elif op=='-':
            return [i-val for i in nums]
        elif op=='*':
            return [val*i for i in nums]
        else:
            return [i//val for i in nums]
