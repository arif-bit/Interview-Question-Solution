Given a list of integers nums, return whether there's an integer whose frequency in the list is same as its value.

Example 1
Input

nums = [7, 9, 3, 3, 3]
Output

True


Solution:

Make a dictionary to count how many times its repeated.
Check count equals to its value.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        dict = {}
        for i in nums:
            if i in dict:
                dict[i] += 1
            else:
                dict[i] = 1

        return any([dict[j] == j for i, j in enumerate(dict)])
