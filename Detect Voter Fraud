Given a two dimensional list of integers votes, where each list has two elements [candidate_id, voter_id], report whether any voter has voted more than once.

Example 1
Input

votes = [
    [3, 1],
    [3, 0],
    [3, 4],
    [3, 3],
    [3, 2]
]
Output

False
Explanation

Every voter has voted once



Solution:
Get the second value of 2D list
check if it has any duplicate value that means voter has voted more than once.

class Solution:
    def solve(self, votes):
        checkVoters = [i[1] for i in votes]
        if len(set(checkVoters)) == len(votes):
            return False
        else:
            return True
