Given a list of integers nums, sort the list in the following way:

First number is the maximum
Second number is the minimum
Third number is the 2nd maximum
Fourth number is the 2nd minimum
And so on.
Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums.
Example 1
Input

nums = [5, 2, 9, 3]
Output

[9, 2, 5, 3]


SOLUTION:

Sort the list both ways, zip the two.
Flatten (using x for y in foo for y in x trick)
Only take the first half (which will be the length of the input of course)

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        return [i for l in zip(sorted(nums, reverse=True), sorted(nums)) for i in l][0 : len(nums)]

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        return [i for l in zip(sorted(nums, reverse=True), sorted(nums)) for i in l][:len(nums)]
